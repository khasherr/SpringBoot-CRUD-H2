# SpringBoot-CRUD-H2
This is Springboot CRUD app with MVC that I did as part of my assignment for the Spring Framework Course.
CRUD operations add update delete
lombok, spring web, spring jpa, H2 database and other dependencies.
bootstrap and search by name and phone number functionality added. 
included resource files that contains with Thymealf, Bootstrap and how data are binded. 

Best resources to learn Spring Framework are Baeldung and Spring Guru <3. It really helped me so much with the course.
